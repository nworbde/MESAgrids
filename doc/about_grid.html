<h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>
<p>Let's start with a simple grid. We'll make it 3 columns by 2 rows. The file width we'll set to 12 (which is about 1152 pixels on my MacBook Pro), and we'll set the aspect ratio (height/width) to 2/3, so that the cells of our grid will be square.</p>
<pre><code>file_width = 12.0
file_aspect_ratio = 0.6666667

grid_num_cols = 3
grid_num_rows = 2
grid_num_plots = 6</code></pre>
<p>We want some padding between the rows; let's set that to 20 px.</p>
<pre><code>grid_col_offset_in_px = 20.0
grid_row_offset_in_px = 20.0</code></pre>
<p>Finally, let's put a border around our grid and set it to be 0.02 of the total window extent.</p>
<pre><code>grid_pad_left = 0.02
grid_pad_right = 0.02
grid_pad_top = 0.02
grid_pad_bottom = 0.02</code></pre>
<p>Now we'll box each grid, using our 'Box' plot</p>
<pre><code>grid_plot_names(1) = &#39;Box&#39;
grid_plot_col(1) = 1
grid_plot_row(1) = 1
grid_plot_colspan(1) = 1
grid_plot_rowspan(1) = 1</code></pre>
<p>and so forth for the other plots. Here is how it looks. <img src="grid0.png" title="3-by-2 grid" alt="grid layout" /></p>
<p>Let's reduce the number of plots: we'll make the upper right and lower left plots span 2 columns:</p>
<pre><code>grid_num_plots = 4
grid_plot_names(1) = &#39;Box&#39;
grid_plot_col(1) = 1
grid_plot_row(1) = 1
grid_plot_colspan(1) = 1
grid_plot_rowspan(1) = 1

grid_plot_names(2) = &#39;Box&#39;
grid_plot_col(2) = 2
grid_plot_row(2) = 1
grid_plot_colspan(2) = 2
grid_plot_rowspan(2) = 1

grid_plot_names(3) = &#39;Box&#39;
grid_plot_col(3) = 1
grid_plot_row(3) = 2
grid_plot_colspan(3) = 2
grid_plot_rowspan(3) = 1

grid_plot_names(4) = &#39;Box&#39;
grid_plot_col(4) = 3
grid_plot_row(4) = 2
grid_plot_colspan(4) = 1
grid_plot_rowspan(4) = 1</code></pre>
<p>Here are the results: <img src="grid1.png" title="with plots spanning muliple columns" /></p>
<p>Of course, we need to allow space for the axes and plot titles. We specify their lengths in units of the character size. Let's specify a target character size of 1 em = 14 px, and make the left, top, and bottom margins 4 em = 56 px:</p>
<pre><code>simplt_pad_left_in_em = 4.0
simplt_pad_right_in_em = 0.0
simplt_pad_top_in_em = 4.0
simplt_pad_bottom_in_em = 4.0
simplt_char_size_in_px = 14.0</code></pre>
<p>(I am using the <code>simplt</code> flags for the boxes as well)</p>
<figure>
<img src="grid2.png" title="with 4.0 em padding on left, bottom, and top" />
</figure>
<p>Note that this spacing is fixed even as we reduce the plot size:</p>
<pre><code>file_width = 9.0</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="grid3.png" title="scaled by 0.75" />
</figure>
<p>Let's go back to our original size and make the upper right and lower left plots have room for a legend that takes up 0.18 of the plot width:</p>
<pre><code>grid_plot_names(2) = &#39;Box_with_Legend&#39;
grid_plot_names(3) = &#39;Box_with_Legend&#39;
lgdplt_legend_width = 0.18
lgdplt_legend_left_margin_in_em = 1.0</code></pre>
<p>We also specifed a gap of 1.0 em between the right edge of the plot and the legend.</p>
<figure>
<img src="grid4.png" title="added legend" />
</figure>
<h2 id="adding-plots">Adding plots</h2>
<p>Now we are ready to add real plots. We have two: 'Simple_Plot', which just draws a sine wave, and 'Legend_Plot', which draws a sine wave and a few harmonics and makes a legend.</p>
<pre><code>grid_plot_names(1) = &#39;Legend_Plot&#39;
grid_plot_names(2) = &#39;Simple_Plot&#39;
grid_plot_names(3) = &#39;Legend_Plot&#39;
grid_plot_names(4) = &#39;Simple_Plot&#39;</code></pre>
<p>We put a maring of 0.5 em at the top, and set the distance between baselines in the legend to be 1.2 em; we specify the length of the lines in the legend to be 2.0em:</p>
<pre><code>lgdplt_legend_top_margin_in_em = 0.5
lgdplt_legend_lineskip_in_em = 1.2
lgdplt_legend_line_length_in_em = 2.0 </code></pre>
<p>This gives the following plot.</p>
<figure>
<img src="plt0.png" title="plot with legend" />
</figure>
<p>Notice that the text retains its size as we scale up</p>
<pre><code>file_width = 15.0</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="plt1.png" title="scaled up" />
</figure>
<p>and down</p>
<pre><code>file_width = 9.0</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="plt2.png" title="scaled down" />
</figure>
<p>Of course, our legend is now too big. Let's reduce that to 70% of the current text size</p>
<pre><code>lgdplt_legend_txt_scale = 0.7</code></pre>
<p>This also reduces the line lengths, since they are in units of text size.</p>
<figure>
<img src="plt3.png" title="legend reduced by 0.7" />
</figure>
<p>Let's push the legend down and increase the spacing between lines</p>
<pre><code>lgdplt_legend_top_margin_in_em = 2.5
lgdplt_legend_lineskip_in_em = 2.0</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="plt4.png" title="moved legend" />
</figure>
<p>Finally, let's set the target character size on the simple plots (upper left and lower right) to be 10px:</p>
<pre><code>simplt_char_size_in_px = 10.0</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="plt5.png" title="with text size change on the simple plot" />
</figure>
